# number-finder
this program helps you find an integer whose root is a decimal number of your choice

the c program can find roots upto 25
and the slower python one uses binary search method to find roots upto 15


go with the c one for good results

just change the variable on the first few lines of code (the default is 2.71... to anything you like)
